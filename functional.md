# Crappy Bird



## Functional Specification

Introduction / Summary

This project is a clone of the well-known and much-hated mobile application Flappy Bird. Let’s start with some history. Flappy Bird was first uploaded in 2014. After becoming a hit, it was quickly generating lots of profit. With profit came attention, and with attention came hate. Lots of it. So much hate, actually, that the original app was taken down 28 days later. Fans were literally sending death threats to the creator of this simple, yet impossibly difficult app. Missing the simple joys, I have decided to undertake the noble task of creating a clone, albeit an easier one. I do not wish to receive death threats, which is why my clone is slightly easier, although no less fun. I wouldn’t call myself a hero, but someone else definitely should.

Access

The user can play my game on http://runpython.com with this url: https://github.com/HHStudent/Final-Project/blob/master/crappycode.py

Graphics

I am a flappy bird purist and have stuck to only the original materials. The images used are imported straight from Flappy Bird screenshots on Google images, not illegitimate third party black market Flappy Bird knock offs. This includes: one original epic background, two pipes, one bottom and one top, and one flappy bird. Starting the game, you control the bird on the left side of the screen jumping over the background, as pipe graphics move toward you. The background is still for the entire game, but you control the bird. Pressing nothing, the bird will slowly begin to fall. Pressing the space bar, the bird rises 30 pixels. Pipes, on the other hand, steadily move towards you at a rate of 12 pixels per second. Hitting the pipes with the bird will result in a game over. The graphics are for enhancing the overall Flappy Experience.

Mouse Input

The program does not respond to mouse input.

Keyboard Input

The only key that the program responds to is the space bar. Pressing it will move the bird up 30 pixels.

Extra Installations

The user will not have to do anything to install this program.
